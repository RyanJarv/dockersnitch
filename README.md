This was a very minimal implentation of something like littlesnitch but for docker, there are probably better ways to do this but this was what initially came to mind when I started working on this.

Sorry, no docs but if you're interested in how this is meant to be used you can take a look at [coderun](https://github.com/RyanJarv/coderun/tree/coderun-v1).
